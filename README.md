# GeoData_visualisation
In this project I tried to create 3d undrestandable interactive html visualisations of geo-data using python and pyVista library which is created for this specific purpose.
The data which can be integrated are Coordinates like (Longitude and Latitude), temprature, height or depth, and target values like O2 ,Co2 or other Concentrations.
Then it's possible to compare the map which you create regarding the real data and the city map to have a better perception of what is happening exactly in each point of a city.
As an example, look at these two maps in which the Oxyge Concentration of an underground level is shown and the other is the geographical position of mentioned points dicussed in the first image.

The image above is a 3d interactive representation of Oxygen Concentration (mg/L) in underground of the City Karlsruhe (South-west of Germany). 
Data can't be published due to ownership rights, but regarding the code simply you can replace your own data.

This image is resulted by plotting the geographical data of the same city (simply use coordinates, no matter in which system they are calculated)
